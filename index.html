<h3>Interactive Campus Map</h3>
<p> In Spring 2013 I was working on developing an Interactive Campus Map as part of GEOG790. 
This involved learning JavaScript, Leaflet and OpenStreetMap. 
For this project we primarily used the <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> and <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> libraries.

<h3>GIS Jobs Map</h3>
<p> In Spring 2013 I took the GEOG567 course at NIU, creating a map using Adobe Illustrator. 
We had to incorporate some GIS layers, I used city and climate data along with major interstates and state boundaries. 
I also used this shaded relief from <a href="http://www.shadedrelief.com/physical/pages/download.html">Shadedrelief.com</a> as a background. 
The project involved a lot of digitizing in Illustrator, in fact almost everything other than the relief map!

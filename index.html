                <p class="project"> In Spring 2013 I was working on developing an Interactive Campus Map as part of GEOG790. 
                This involved learning JavaScript, Leaflet and OpenStreetMap. 
                Campus buildings and features were added to OpenStreetMap as part of this project, and the MapQuest Nominatum API and Overpass API were used to access the OSM data.
                I also used the <a class="link" href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> and <a class="link" href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> libraries.

                <p class="project"> In Spring 2013 I took the GEOG567 course at NIU, creating a map using Adobe Illustrator. 
                I obtained a heatmap of GIS job advertisements along with the relevant city and climate data. the heatmap was smoothed and digitized, along with major interstates, state boundaries, highway shields etc. 
                For the background I used a shaded relief image from <a class="link" href="http://www.shadedrelief.com/physical/pages/download.html">Shadedrelief.com</a>.

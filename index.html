            This is a simple portfolio of web pages and maps (well, those that I can host here on GitHub anyway). It is very much a work in progress so please forgive the basic styling.

                <p class="project">
                In Spring 2013 I built an Interactive Campus Map as part of GEOG790. 
                This involved learning JavaScript, Leaflet and OpenStreetMap. 
                Campus buildings and features were added to OpenStreetMap as part of this project, and the MapQuest Nominatum API and Overpass API were used to access the OSM data.
                I also used the <a class="link" href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> and <a class="link" href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> libraries.

                <p class="project">
                In Spring 2013 I took the GEOG567 course at NIU, creating a map using Adobe Illustrator. 
                I obtained a heatmap of GIS job advertisements along with the relevant city and climate data. the heatmap was smoothed and digitized, along with major interstates, state boundaries, highway shields etc. 
                For the background I used a shaded relief image from <a class="link" href="http://www.shadedrelief.com/physical/pages/download.html">Shadedrelief.com</a>.

                <p class="project">
                This tool is based on VBA code downloaded many years ago from the ESRI script sharing section. Alas,  the original code appear to have now vanished, and when the time came to upgrade to ArcMap 10.0 in 2011 (and the upcoming deprecation of VBA) I decided to rewrite the tool in .Net for a learning opportunity. This turned out to be fairly straightforward and I took the opportunity to tidy up a few things while I was at it. The entire source code is provided in a Visual Studio solution.

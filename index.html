<h3>Interactive Campus Map</h3>
<p> In Spring 2013 I was working on developing an Interactive Campus Map as part of GEOG790. 
This involved learning JavaScript, Leaflet and OpenStreetMap. 
For this project we primarily used the <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> and <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> libraries.

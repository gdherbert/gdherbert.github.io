<h3>Interactive Campus Map</h3>
<p> In Spring 2013 I was working on developing an Interactive Campus Map as part of GEOG790. 
This involved learning JavaScript, Leaflet and OpenStreetMap. 
Campus buildings and features were added to OpenStreetMap as part of this project, and the MapQuest Nominatum API and Overpass API were used to access the OSM data.
For this project we primarily used the <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> and <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> libraries.

<h3>GIS Jobs Map</h3>
<p> In Spring 2013 I took the GEOG567 course at NIU, creating a map using Adobe Illustrator. 
We had to incorporate some GIS layers, I used city and climate data along with major interstates and state boundaries. 
I also used this shaded relief from <a href="http://www.shadedrelief.com/physical/pages/download.html">Shadedrelief.com</a> as a background. 
The project involved a lot of digitizing in Illustrator, in fact almost everything other than the relief map!
